## Frontend Technology Used:
* HTML: for creating the structure and content of the website

* CSS, Bootstrap, React-Bootstrap: for styling and designing the website, including layout, colors, fonts, and animations. Also creating responsive and mobile-first web designs using pre-built CSS classes and JavaScript plugins including forms, buttons, modals, and alerts

* JavaScript: for adding interactivity and functionality to the website, such as event handling, form validation, and dynamic content generation

* Axios: for building and consuming RESTful APIs, including authentication and authorization of API requests using JSON Web Tokens (JWTs)

* React-router-dom: for client-side routing and navigation in single-page applications built using React.js

* Helmet: for securing the website by setting HTTP headers and protecting against common web vulnerabilities.

* Joi: for validating and sanitizing user input in server-side Node.js applications, including data types, formats, and constraints

* JsonWebToken: for generating and verifying JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in server-side Node.js applications, including user authentication and authorization.
## Backend Technology Used:

* Node.js: It is a JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It provides a scalable and efficient way to handle I/O operations and network requests.

* Express: It is a popular web framework for Node.js that provides a set of tools and utilities for building web applications. It simplifies the process of creating RESTful APIs and handling HTTP requests and responses.

* MongoDB: It is a NoSQL database that uses a document-oriented data model. It provides a flexible and scalable way to store and manage data. It's often used in combination with Node.js and Express to build web applications.

* Joi: It is a validation library for JavaScript that allows developers to validate user input and data structures. It provides a simple and declarative way to define validation rules for objects and arrays.

* Bcrypt: It is a library for encrypting passwords and sensitive data. It uses a one-way hashing algorithm to encrypt data, making it difficult for hackers to retrieve the original data.

* .env: It is a file that stores environment variables for an application. It provides a convenient way to store sensitive data such as database credentials and API keys outside of the codebase.

* cors: It is a middleware that allows cross-origin resource sharing. It enables a web application to interact with resources from a different domain. It's often used in combination with Express to handle CORS-related issues.
